steps on development server:
	create directory in ~/projects/ruby
	download existing feed here
	remove all posts and copy resulting feed into 2 files: main file and excluded.xml
		it may be worth saving one or more posts as examples
	determine 5 critical xml selectors - example: item, channel, build date, channel build date, feedburner:origLink
	copy simple config file and update
		set feed url
		set critical selectors
		set directory
		set feed filename (without extension)
		update criteria for exclusion
		update title of main section
	to test:
		update test_generate.sh by adding another job to execute
		create the directory for the feed filename and set its permissions to 777
		create a local directory in /var/www/html and set its permissions to 777
		copy empty feed files into that new directory
	update generate_feeds.sh by adding another job to execute
	update copy_files.sh to send the newly create files as part of new deployments
	commit all changes and new files to git
	push changes to github (git push origin master)
	to deploy files to the server, run copy_files.sh

TODO:
	consider updating copy_files.sh to use git to determine which files to send...

steps on remote server:
	create directory for new feed files in /var/www/html
	change the owner to ubuntu:ubuntu
	copy empty xml files to seed the directory
	run generate_feeds.sh to test the process
